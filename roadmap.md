## ðŸ“ž Integration Handoff Notes

### For Backend Development Team:
1. **Wallet Integration**: Replace mock functions in `useWallet.ts` with actual Stacks wallet connectivity
2. **API Endpoints**: Implement the API calls mocked in `useProfile.ts` and `useLinks.ts`
3. **Data Persistence**: Connect the mock data structures to actual database/blockchain storage
4. **Authentication**: Implement wallet-based authentication system

### For Smart Contract Team:
1. **Profile Contract**: Implement user profile storage and management
2. **Links Contract**: Create link storage with ownership and ordering
3. **Analytics Contract**: Add click tracking and analytics data storage
4. **Payment Contract**: Implement monetization features for premium users

### File Structure for Integration:
```
Key files requiring backend integration:
- src/hooks/useWallet.ts (Wallet connectivity)
- src/hooks/useProfile.ts (User data management) 
- src/hooks/useLinks.ts (Link CRUD operations)
- src/types/index.ts (Data structure definitions)
```
